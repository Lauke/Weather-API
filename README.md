* Created an API key on openweathermap.org
* Read the axios documentation and included it in my html file
* Learned how to fetch data using axios

* Temperature shows up in the html
* Added an error message if the city not found / spelled incorrectly

### 11.05.2021

* Removed the document.createElement and replaced them with .innerHTML (prevented from creating new forecasts whenever clicking the button)
* Spent the whole day figuring out how to get the daily forecast of coming 5 days
* Eventually ended up using a second API (one call API)
* Experimented in using moment.js to format dates
* Implemented bootstrap in the page
