# Weather API

* In progress

## Progress
* Created an API key on openweathermap.org
* Read the axios documentation and included it in my html file
* Learned how to fetch data using axios
* Added a function so you can search the city temp by name (only in console still) using string interpolation
* Temperature shows up in the html
* Added an error message if the city not found / spelled incorrectly
